# Litter Index
The Litter Index is a is a simple tool that allows a quick visual assessment of the amount of litter present in our community. To conduct the survey, Philadelphia is divided into the twenty three Police Districts. PMBC (Philadelphia More Beautiful Committee) officers visit each district and examine a random sub-areas within those districts to provide a score for each location based on the amount of visible litter. Those subareas are some intersections, small blocks, large blocks, with trash cans, without trash cans etc., visited on trash days, non-trash days, windy days, rainy days, and their scores averaged. Scores range from 1 (virtually no litter) to 4 (extremely littered). The final index for each district is calculated by combining and then averaging the scores compiled from the sub-areas by the PMBC officers.
